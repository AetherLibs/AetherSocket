# AetherSocket
AetherSocket is a next-gen WebSocket specification built for the modern web.
https://g.aether.codes/aethersocket/

Built on standards like [WebSocket](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455), [WebTransport](https://w3c.github.io/webtransport/), and [HTTP/3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-34), AetherSocket is the made for long-term and short-term socket connections. 

## Status
AetherSocket was introduced in Chromium 97 as WebTransport was introduced in 97. However, AetherSocket is meant more for app-to-app connections and app-to-server connections, and less browser support.
